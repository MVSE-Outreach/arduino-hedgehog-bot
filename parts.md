# Parts

This page is a list of parts to get the kit together yourself at home.

#### Parts list

We order all our electronics from banggood.com. It's super cheap but the parts are shipped from China, so they take a few weeks to arrive.  
We buy in bulk to make things cheaper, but below are links for enough parts for one robot.
