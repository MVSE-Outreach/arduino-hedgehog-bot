# Installation scripts

The primary script is targeted at Windows, as most of our users are on that
platform.

## Windows set up

Copy the `windows-setup.ps1` script to a memory stick and run it on a computer
you wish to set up. It will cache the dependencies alongside the script so that
subsequent runs will be faster as nothing will have to be downloaded.

## Linux set up

Run `linux-setup.sh` to install sketches and libraries to arduino folder.
