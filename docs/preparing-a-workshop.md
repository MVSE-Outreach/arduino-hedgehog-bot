# Preparing a workshop

## Ordering parts

### Suppliers

[Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/) has the best prices for the parts we
use, however it has lead times of ~40 days so is best suited to bulk orders
for 100s of kits.

[Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/) has traditionally been the source of
parts for the kits with slightly better shipping times than Aliexpress,
typically 7-20 business days.

[eBay](http://ebay.co.uk/) and [Amazon](amazon.co.uk) have been used for parts
when we've been up against short deadlines needing to prep for workshops with
a few weeks notice. It tends to cost a lot per bot, hence whenever we can we
try and buy from China.

Banggood is considerably more expensive than Aliexpress (Will Price conducted
a comparison in Sept 2017 for pricing for 100 bots, Aliexpress came out at
~£10/bot, and Banggood at ~£18/bot).

Both [buyabattery.co.uk](https://www.buyabattery.co.uk/procell-9v-batteries-box-of-50-bulk-now-duracell-industrial.html),

[batterystation.co.uk](https://www.batterystation.co.uk/9v-batteries/industrial-by-duracell-9v-pp3-6lr1-id1604-batteries-box-of-50),
and [LYCO](https://www.lyco.co.uk/duracell-industrial-alkaline-batteries-9v-pack-of-50.html)
provide good prices for 9V batteries in boxes of 50 pieces. They Have next day delivery for not much money.

### Choosing a supplier

Factors of consideration:

* How long have you got until the workshop?
* How many kits do you need?
* How many kits are in currently in inventory?
* How long until you need the parts in working days? Remember it takes a full
  day to put together a set of kits and you'll need to organise people to help
  you do this. It takes a while for the order to filter through university
  purchasing and actually be placed, again you have to account for this.

| Supplier | Typical lead time (working days) | Comments |
| [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/) | 40 | We haven't had experience placing an order from Aliexpress yet |
| [Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/) | 7-20 | Typically arrive in under a month from placing an order |


## Putting together kits

* Choose an afternoon and advertise for helpers on the SCEEM facebook group (3 or
  4 is a good number)
* Get envelopes to store each kit in
* Set up a packing line to produce kits
  * Each person is responsible for placing a small number of components into
    the envelope they are passed. They should have the parts close to them to
    minimize the time it takes to put parts into the kits.
  * Check the first kit produced by the packing line against the kit listing
    to ensure no parts have been missed

## Setting up university laptops

NOTE: You'll need admin access to set up a university laptop.

Follow the [installation instrutions](laptop-setup.md).

## Sampling and verifying kits (with university laptops)

* Randomly sample 10% of the kits you have prepared
* Check all parts are present
* Build the kits following the instructions on [hedgehogbot.co.uk](http://hedgehogbot.co.uk)
* Program each of the bots with
  [challenge2](http://www.hedgehogbot.co.uk/challenge2.html) ensuring that the bots can move and the screen displays a face

## Final checks

* [ ] Ensure all the laptops that are going to the workshop have been set up.
* [ ] Ensure you have enough kits for the workshop (ideally bring 10% extra).
* [ ] Plan for component failure and bring spares of each component.
* [ ] Bring files in case the bodies are incorrectly produced and need fettling.
