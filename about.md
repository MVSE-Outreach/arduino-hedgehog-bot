# About Hedgehog Bot

#### What is it?

Hedgehog Bot is a build-it-yourself IOT (Internet-of-Things) robot kit. Designed for anyone aged 10 and above to learn about programming and building electronics.

#### What is IoT?

IoT refers to the interconnection&mdash;via the Internet&mdash;of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.

#### Why the name?

When showing people our prototype, they compared the wiry exterior of our bot to that of a hedgehog and the name stuck.

#### What’s it made of?

The Hedgehog Bot has a body made of MDF and uses readily available screen, motor, Wi-Fi and microprocessor parts&mdash;as well a few wires! This results in a really low cost kit.

#### What do you need?

As well as the kit, you’ll need:

-   A computer running Windows, macOS or Linux
-   For Challenge 3, a smartphone (optional)

#### Who are we?

The Hedgehog Bot was created by Scott and Joe - graduate electronic engineers from the University of Bristol. We have a passion for technology and education and we hope this kit brings those things together.

It is maintained by Will, Ed, James and other volunteers at the University of Bristol's SCEEM Outreach Programme and [DigiMakers](https://digimakers.co.uk/).

This project was funded by the [Blake Memorial Fund](https://bristol.ac.uk/fees-funding/awards/blake-memorial-fund/).
