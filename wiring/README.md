# Wiring Diagrams

The wiring diagrams in the directories below have been produced with
[fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/).

Install Fritzing, and open any of the wiring diagrams (files ending in `.fzz`).

If you want to create new wiring diagrams you might want to add the
parts to your Fritzing library. To do so, open up Fritzing and in the
*Parts* widget, click the top right drop down menu and select *Import*
and open an *.fzpz* file which will be imported into the *Mine* parts
bin.
